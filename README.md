# Precious-Plastic-Compiled-Laser-Files
Repository containing compiled laser files for precious plastic ecosystem for ease of use

## Introduction
This repository has taken laser files of open source machines that recycle plastic from the [Precious plastic kit](https://github.com/ONEARMY/precious-plastic-kit) and compiled them into an easy to find and use format.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. All files have been taken from the starter kit and organised them to make them easier to get quotes/sent to a laser shop.
2. Any updates, corrections or translations to the these compiled blueprints can be found at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Precious-Plastic-Compiled-Laser-Files">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Precious-Plastic-Compiled-Laser-Files</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.
